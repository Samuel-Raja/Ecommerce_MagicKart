This is an ecommerce website built using React.JS, Redux, Firebase, Sanity.io, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, and Stripe. The frontend of the application was developed using React.JS and Redux for state management. Firebase Authentication and Realtime Database were used for managing user accounts, and Stripe was implemented for handling payments and the checkout process.

The website features a custom CMS as a backend built using Sanity.io for managing the product data. This allows for easy updating and management of the products displayed on the website.
